# Introduction 
This project begins when the need of use godot was strong enought in my head, so I decided pass all the code from a project in unity to godot, this was done in godot 3, I cant wait to see the results porting all to the new
godot 4.

# Build and Test
You need the mono version of godot engine 3 to run and debug this project.

# Contribute
If the code that I wrote is helpful for you, just give me the mention when needed.
Any contribution is welcome.
